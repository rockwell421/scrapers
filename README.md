# scrapers
Node.js Web Scrapers for different websites using the Cheerio library. This is meant merely for scraping content from science and technology news websites and is not for commercial purposes.

I will have to add more features such as piping the scrape meta data into text files. 
You can create some interesting data mining projects if you collect attributes such as titles, rankings, # of shares, etc.

Feel free to contribute!
